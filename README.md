Hotel Management System in C++
This project is a Hotel Management System implemented in C++ that utilizes Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles alongside Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for efficient and scalable design.

Key Features
OOP Concepts: Comprehensive use of classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction for modular and maintainable code.
Data Structures:
Stack: For managing guest check-ins and check-outs.
Trees: For hierarchical data representation, such as room categorization.
Priority Queue: To handle reservations based on customer priority (e.g., VIPs).
Linked List: For maintaining a dynamic list of guests and room availability.
Functionalities
Room reservation, check-in, and check-out.
Customer details management.
Dynamic room allocation and tracking.
Priority-based reservation system.
Error handling and user-friendly menu-driven interface.
Purpose
This project demonstrates the integration of DSA concepts and OOP to create a real-world system. It's ideal for those looking to improve their coding skills and understanding of how programming concepts can solve practical problems.
